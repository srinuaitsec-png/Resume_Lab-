Here’s a clear, beginner-friendly overview of Juniper Networking Fundamentals, commonly expected for interviews, certifications (like JNCIA-Junos), or basic network operations.

1. What is Juniper Networks?

Juniper Networks is a company that designs and sells networking equipment such as:

Routers

Switches

Firewalls

Security & automation solutions

Juniper is especially known for:

Service provider networks

Data centers

Enterprise networks

2. Junos OS (Core Foundation)

All Juniper devices run Junos OS, which is:

Single OS across all devices

Modular (separate control and forwarding planes)

Highly stable and secure

Key Junos Concepts

Control Plane – Routing protocols, system management

Data (Forwarding) Plane – Packet forwarding

Management Plane – CLI, SSH, NETCONF

3. Juniper Device Types
Routers

MX Series (Service Provider)

PTX Series (Core routing)

SRX (Routing + Security)

Switches

EX Series (Enterprise switching)

QFX Series (Data Center)

Firewalls

SRX Series (Next-Gen Firewall)

4. Junos CLI Basics

Juniper CLI has two main modes:

1. Operational Mode

Used for monitoring and troubleshooting:

show interfaces
show route
show version

2. Configuration Mode

Used to configure devices:

configure
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1/24
commit

5. Configuration Hierarchy

Junos uses a hierarchical configuration structure, similar to a tree:

interfaces
 └── ge-0/0/0
     └── unit 0
         └── family inet
             └── address


This makes configurations:

Easy to read

Easy to roll back

Consistent

6. Interfaces & Naming

Interface format:

ge-0/0/0
│  │ │
│  │ └─ Port
│  └── PIC
└───── FPC


Types:

ge – Gigabit Ethernet

xe – 10 Gigabit

et – 100 Gigabit

7. Routing Fundamentals

Supported routing protocols:

Static Routing

OSPF

IS-IS

BGP

RIP

Example (Static Route):

set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.168.1.254

8. Security Basics (SRX)

Key concepts:

Zones (trust, untrust)

Policies

NAT

Stateful firewall

Traffic flows are controlled by security policies, not interfaces alone.

9. Configuration Management

Juniper provides powerful config control:

commit – Apply changes

commit confirmed – Auto rollback

rollback – Restore previous configs

compare – View changes before commit

10. Common Certifications

JNCIA-Junos (Entry level)

JNCIS (Intermediate)

JNCIP (Professional)

JNCIE (Expert)

11. Why Juniper?

Clean and consistent OS

Strong automation (NETCONF, REST, Python)

Reliable for large-scale networks
